It is a service provided by the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG). The process of obtaining certificates is simplified due to the presence of the Certbot ACME client, which automates almost all the necessary operations, including for Apache.\nDespite the fact that the SSL-certificates Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt free, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that the level of encryption is lower than that of paid certificates. Let’s Encrypt adheres to the highest encryption standards and offers high-security certificates.\nThe differences between Let’s Encrypt certificates and paid certificates #  Cost. Let’s Encrypt will not require money for the installation or update of the certificate. However, it is possible to make a voluntary donation on the project website.\nSpeed and ease of installation. Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt in its work focuses on the automation of absolutely all processes. On a typical Linux web server, only several commands are required to configure HTTPS encryption, obtain and install a certificate in about 20-30 seconds.\nValidity period. The free Let’s Encrypt certificate cannot be obtained for a year, only for 90 days. It needs to be re-released every three months. Certbot will help you set up automatic updates.\nCompatibility. Let’s Encrypt SSL certificates do not work in some older browsers and operating systems. For example, on computers with Windows XP version below SP3 or devices with Android version below 2.3.6.\nSupport. Let’s Encrypt does not have a support service that you can contact if you have questions about the installation or operation of the certificate. You can find answers in the technical documentation or on the forum.\nBefore installation #  Before you start following the steps in this article, make sure that:\n  your Ubuntu server is configured for non-root user access with sudo privileges and access to firewall configuration;;\n  both DNS records below are configured for your server;\n an A record for documentat.io, specifying the public IP address of your server; an A record for www.documentat.io, specifying the public IP address of your server.    configured virtual host file for your domain.\n  We will use Certbot to get a free SSL certificate and configure the automatic updates of this certificate.\nWe will also use a separate Apache virtual host file instead of the default configuration file. We recommend creating new Apache virtual host files for each domain name. This will help avoid common mistakes and use the default file as an example of the correct configuration if anything goes wrong.\nIn this guide, we will use /etc/apache2/sites-available/documentat.io.conf.\n Step 1. Installing Certbot #  Before using Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt to obtain SSL certificates, install Certbot on your server.\nCertbot is under active development, so the Certbot packages provided by Ubuntu are usually outdated. However, the Certbot developers maintain their Ubuntu package repository up to date, so we will use this repository.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s add the repository:\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot Next press ENTER.\nInstall the Certbot Apache package using apt:\n$ sudo apt install python-certbot-apache Certbot is now ready to use. But at first, we need to check the Apache settings, In order for it to be able to configure SSL for Apache.\nStep 2. Configuring an SSL certificate #  Certbot must be able to find the correct virtual host in your Apache configuration in order to automatically configure SSL. To do this, it will look for a ServerName directive that matches the domain name for which you are requesting a certificate.\nYour virtual host for your domain should be located at /etc/apache2/sites-available/documentat.io.conf with the already correctly configured ServerName directive.\nTo check, open the config file in nano or any other text editor:\n$ sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/documentat.io.conf Find the line with ServerName. It should look something like this:\n... ServerName documentat.io; ... If it looks like this, close the file and go to the next step.\nIf it does not look as described above, update the ServerName directive. Then save and close the file, then check the correct syntax of your configuration file with the command:\n$ sudo apache2ctl configtest If you get an error, open the config file and check it for typos or missing characters. After your config file is checked for correctness, restart Apache to apply the new configuration:\n$ sudo systemctl reload apache2 Now Certbot can find and update the correct virtual host.\nNext, let\u0026rsquo;s update the firewall settings to allow HTTPS traffic.\nStep 3. Allow HTTPS in the firewall #  If you have ufw firewall enabled, as recommended in the initial server configuration guide, you need to make some changes to its settings to allow HTTPS traffic. Apache usually registers the required profiles with ufw during the installation.\nYou can see the current settings with the command:\n$ sudo ufw status Most likely the output will look like this:\nStatus: active To Action From -- ------ ---- OpenSSH ALLOW Anywhere Apache ALLOW Anywhere OpenSSH (v6) ALLOW Anywhere (v6) Apache (v6) ALLOW Anywhere (v6) As you can see from the output, only HTTP traffic is allowed.\nTo allow HTTPS traffic, enable the Apache Full profile and remove the redundant Apache profile:\n$ sudo ufw allow 'Apache Full' $ sudo ufw delete allow 'Apache' Let\u0026rsquo;s check the changes made:\n$ sudo ufw status Now the ufw settings should look like this:\nStatus: active To Action From -- ------ ---- OpenSSH ALLOW Anywhere Apache Full ALLOW Anywhere OpenSSH (v6) ALLOW Anywhere (v6) Apache Full (v6) ALLOW Anywhere (v6) Next, we can launch Certbot and get the certificates.\nStep 4. Obtaining an SSL certificate #  Certbot provides several ways to obtain SSL certificates using plugins. The Apache plugin assumes the configure of Apache and reload the configuration when needed. To use the plugin, run the command:\n$ sudo certbot --apache -d example.com -d www.example.com This command runs certbot with the -apache plugin, the d keys specify the domain names for which the certificate should be issued.\nSince this is the first time you run certbot, you will be prompted to enter your email address and agree to the terms of use of the service. The certbot will then contact the Let’s Encrypt server and then verify that you really control the domain for which you requested the certificate.\nIf everything went well, certbot will ask how you want to set up your HTTPS configuration.\nPlease choose whether or not to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, removing HTTP access. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1: No redirect - Make no further changes to the webserver configuration. 2: Redirect - Make all requests redirect to secure HTTPS access. Choose this for new sites, or if you're confident your site works on HTTPS. You can undo this change by editing your web server's configuration. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Select the appropriate number [1-2] then [enter] (press 'c' to cancel): Select the appropriate option and press ENTER. The configuration will be updated and Apache will be restarted to apply the changes. Certbot will display a message stating that the process was successful and where your certificates are stored:\nIMPORTANT NOTES: - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/documentat.io/fullchain.pem Your key file has been saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/documentat.io/privkey.pem Your cert will expire on 2020-12-23. To obtain a new or tweaked version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again with the \u0026quot;certonly\u0026quot; option. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run \u0026quot;certbot renew\u0026quot; - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so making regular backups of this folder is ideal. - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by: Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt: https://letsencrypt.org/donate Donating to EFF: https://eff.org/donate-le Your certificates are downloaded, installed, and working. Try reloading your site using https:// and you will see a security icon in your browser. It means that the connection to the site is encrypted, usually, it looks like a green lock icon. If you test your server with the SSL Labs Server Test, it will receive an A grade.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s finish by testing the certificate update process.\nStep 5. Checking automatic update of the certificate #  Let’s Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days only. However, the certbot package updates them on its own by adding an update script to /etc/cron.d. This script runs once a day and automatically updates any certificates that expire within the next 30 days.\nTo test the update process, we can dry run certbot:\n$ sudo certbot renew --dry-run If you don\u0026rsquo;t see any errors as a result of this command, then everything is fine. Certbot will update your certificates as needed and restart Apache to apply the changes. If the automatic update fails for any reason, Let’s Encrypt will send an email to the email address you provided with information about the certificate that will expire soon.\n"});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/en/docs/guide-lets-encrypt-for-nginx-en/','title':"How to enable HTTPS on your site with nginx using Let's Encrypt",'section':"Docs",'content':"How to enable HTTPS on your site with nginx using Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt #  Let’s Encrypt is a free, automated, and open certificate authority (CA), run for the public’s benefit.
